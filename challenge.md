# ðŸ’ª Challenge

Review the [design spec](./specs/add-video-embed.md) to see your task.

To complete this challenge, you will need to use Ruby (Jekyll), and almost certainly Javascript and CSS as well.

The goal is to complete everything listed under "Requirements" in the design spec. If you finish, feel free to tackle the items under "Nice to have".

You have **3 hours** to complete this task. Please stick to this time limit.

#### It is totally okay if you don't finish!

Once 3 hours is up, please create a pull request (**in your own Github repo**), and email your repo and pull request link to us.

Note: **Do not count** dev environment setup as part of your 3 hour limit. Start the clock once you've gotten everything set up and are able to successfully run the project on your machine. You can of course do this challenge in chunks. As long as your total project time limit does not exceed 3 hours.


## ðŸ™Œ Pull Request

Your pull request description should detail:

* Changes you've made
* Approach you took
* What you were able to complete


### If you didn't finish within 3 hours...

Again, it's totally fine (seriously), please also include the following in your PR description:

* What you weren't able to complete
* How another developer can take over to complete it


### If you did finish within 3 hours...

Feel free to add additional enhancements (e.g. fancy designs, additional embed support, tests, etc...)
